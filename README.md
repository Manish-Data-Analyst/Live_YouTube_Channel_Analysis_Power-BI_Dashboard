# 🚀 Live_YouTube_Channel_Analysis_Power-BI_Dashboard🎥📊
I’m excited to share a live dashboard I recently built using Power BI, and using YouTube API, DAX, and Power Query M Code!
<br>
🔍 What It Does:
This dashboard provides real-time insights into any YouTube channel, including:
<br>
**📌 Channel Insights**
<br>
Channel Name
<br>
Subscriber Count
<br>
Thumbnail
<br>
Description
<br>
Direct Channel Link
<br>

**🎬 Video Insights**
<br>
Video Thumbnails & Titles
<br>
Descriptions
<br>
Like, Comment, Share, and View Counts
<br>
**Note:** The video data is only of the latest 20 uploaded on that channel. We can increase this number as per our requirement
<br>
💡 Bonus: I even integrated a functional Subscribe button directly within the dashboard for an interactive experience!
<br>
🔗 Data Source: All data is pulled dynamically using YouTube API, combined and transformed with DAX and Power Query.
<br>
This dashboard is a great tool for content creators, marketers, or analysts who want to monitor performance, compare competitors, or just gain deeper visibility into YouTube metrics.
<br>
💬 Would love to hear your thoughts! Feel free to connect if you're interested in data storytelling, dashboard design, or API integrations.
